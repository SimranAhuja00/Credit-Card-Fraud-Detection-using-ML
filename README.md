# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-ML

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue in the financial industry, causing substantial losses to both credit card companies and consumers alike. To combat this problem, machine learning techniques have been widely adopted for fraud detection. In this project, we aim to develop a credit card fraud detection system using the <b>Logistic Regression</b> algorithm. Logistic Regression is a supervised learning method that is well-suited for binary classification tasks like fraud detection.</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>The project will utilize a labeled dataset containing historical credit card transactions, with each transaction labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset will include various features related to each transaction. This data will be used to train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model. The dataset used is:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud</p>
